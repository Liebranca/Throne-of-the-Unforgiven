This started out as an experiment; I wanted to see how far I could push the engine, and how much of that pushing my hardware could take.
 Sadly, it has reached the point were my current system cannot handle things all that well. Thus, I'm shelving this until upgrading this rig becomes more affordable.
 
 A lot of things are missing, some other things are held together by duct tape. But what little is there works fine.
 If you want to do something with this and need help understanding how a module works, you talk to me.
